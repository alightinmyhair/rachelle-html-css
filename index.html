            <h3>It all started with...</h3>
            <p>When I was 7-8 years old, my family started raising and breeding Rottweilers. So from an early age, I was surrounded by dogs. Our first rottweiler was our alpha and his name was Zeus. Over the years
                we had 7 litters with 6-9 puppies in each litter.
            </p>
            <h3>Facts about Rottweilers</h3>
            <p>Here are some quick facts about this breed of dog:</p>
            <div class="mover">

                    <ul><li>Guarding and protection work</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Since they were bred to work, Rottweilers do best with training and jobs to do, even if just as a child's companion.</li></ul>

            <p>Rottweilers are one of the oldest breeds and there is a town in Germany called Rottweil, named after the breed. They were a working dog breed that drove cattle to the market, pulled
                carts, guarded the homestead and even carried money in a money belt around their neck. Rottweilers are also in the mastiff family. To read more on Rottweilers, click

            <p>Soon after my love of dogs started, I came across elephants in middle school. Something about elephants struck me. I cannot recall whether
                it was hearing how elephants were killed for their ivory but my love and passion for elephants grew.

            <h3>Facts about Elephants</h3>
            <p>Here are some quick facts about elephants:</p>
            <div><ol>
                <li><strong>Tusks:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>These are actually long incisor teeth! These teeth continue growing throughout their lifetime.</li></ul>
                <li><strong>Trunk:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>Elephants have one to two finger like projections (dependent on the species) making it easy to pick up small objects.</li></ul>
                <ul><li>There are more than 100,000 muscles in a trunk!</li></ul>
                <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong></li>
                <ul><li>Elephants have the largest brain of any land animal.</li></ul>
                <ul><li>They mourn their dead and show empathy.</li></ul>
            </ol></div>
            <p>There are 3 surviving elephant species today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asian elephant</li>
                    <li>African savanna elephant</li>
                    <li>African forest elephant</li>
                </ul>
            <article class="boxy">
                <p>These three species differ in anatomical and behavioral differences. But sadly, each species are in decline and of each species only a few
                hundred thousand remains. Thus, because they are <strong>"keystone species"</strong>, which means they are integral to other species, if they become extinct this means 
                entire ecosystems would change drastically. To read more on elephants, click <a href="https://www.elephants.com/about-elephants">here</a>.
