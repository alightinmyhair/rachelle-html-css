        <h3>It all started with...</h3>
        <p>When I was 7-8 years old, my family started raising and breeding Rottweilers. So from an early age, I was surrounded by dogs. Our first rottweiler was our alpha and his name was Zeus. Over the years
            we had 7 litters with 6-9 puppies in each litter.
        </p>

        <p>Rottweilers are one of the oldest breeds and there is a town in Germany called Rottweil, named after the breed. They were a working dog breed that drove cattle to the market, pulled
            carts, guarded the homestead and even carried money in a money belt around their neck. Rottweilers are also in the mastiff family. To read more on Rottweilers, click

        <h3>Next up...</h3>
        <p>Soon after my love of dogs started, I came across elephants in middle school. Something about elephants struck me. I cannot recall whether
            it was hearing how elephants were killed for their ivory but my love and passion for elephants grew. 
        </p>
        <h3>Facts about Elephants</h3>
        <p>Here are some quick facts about elephants:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tusks:</li>
            <ul><li>These are actually long incisor teeth! These teeth continue growing throughout their lifetime.</li></ul>
            <li>Trunk:</li>
            <ul><li>Elephants have one to two finger like projections (dependent on the species) making it easy to pick up small objects.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>There are more than 100,000 muscles in a trunk!</li></ul>
            <li>Intelligence:</li>
            <ul><li>Elephants have the largest brain of any land animal.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>They mourn their dead and show empathy.</li></ul>
        </ol>
        <p>There are 3 surviving elephant species today:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Asian elephant</li>
                <li>African savanna elephant</li>
                <li>African forest elephant</li>
            </ul>
        <p>These three species differ in anatomical and behavioral differences. But sadly, each species are in decline and of each species only a few
        hundred thousand remains. Thus, because they are "keystone species", which means they are integral to other species, if they become extinct this means 
        entire ecosystems would change drastically. To read more on elephants, click <a href="https://www.elephants.com/about-elephants">here</a>
